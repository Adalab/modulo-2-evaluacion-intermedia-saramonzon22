# First Evaluation excersice, module 2 in Adalab
### Module 2
#### Description :page_facing_up:
In this excersice we have to made web page,   
rather, a *game* web page using the concepts we learned in module 2. The tools we can use are the maquetations tools we learned en module 1 and some new knowledge about JavaScript!

#### Programs :books:
For that excersice I use VS Code some resources of MDN web_docs. 
#### Work Method :computer:
In first place I structured all the HTML, without any styles. When I had a composition I like, beginning to give some styles in descending order. In that case we have a main that ocuped all the page.   
When I had this ready I beging to analice the JS structure I needed. With all this clear, it only remained to code it and see that it worked! 
#### Impressions :chart_with_upwards_trend:

From the beginning I started to work with many doubts, because I think the example was a little bit difficult, but by dividing it into parts, it became much simpler. Hope you can play the game, and enjoy trying to get the correct number. I invite you to check it! :fire:
